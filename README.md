# Megaman-X5-disable-time-limit-countdown-hours-save
Megaman X5, this is a save file for Duckstation I created by manually playing the game, losing on purpose in Squid Adler's level, making the timer tick down, BUT launching the Enigma and Shuttle again and again until it actually works! No bosses beaten, nothing collected, just the intro level beat. 4 save files depending on your preference
