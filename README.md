# Megaman-X5-disable-time-limit-countdown-hours-save
Megaman X5, this is a save file for Duckstation I created by manually playing the game, losing on purpose in Squid Adler's level, making the timer tick down, BUT launching the Enigma and Shuttle again and again until it actually works, and Zero stays alive! No bosses beaten, nothing collected, just the intro level beat. 4 Data Slots depending on your preference

Zero is still available and alive in all 4 Data Slots. If you want him dead you can literally just not use this save data, ignore the timer, and let it expire.

(Ignore DATA 1 that's just what I used to save my progress with this save file.)

Here's what the save file means:

DATA 5: Normal Zero opening, timer disabled, no bosses beaten

DATA 6: Normal Megaman X opening (Fourth Armor), timer disabled, no bosses beaten

DATA 7: Black Zero opening, timer disabled, no bosses beaten

DATA 8: Ultimate Armor Megaman X opening, timer disabled, no bosses beaten

I got the save file from this location on my linux Duckstation .appimage:

/home/deck/.local/share/duckstation/memcards/Mega Man X5 (USA)_1.mcd

But if you're on Windows, I don't know where it stores the saves. But still, Duckstation will still work, if you find that save file, and replace it with this one, no matter what OS you're using.
